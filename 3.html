    <strong>They are my <u>FAMILY</u></strong>.
    <u>CCBB</u> is my <strong>FAMILY</strong>. <u>we are <strong>FAMILY</strong></u>

    We all have a superhero inside us, it just takes a bit of magic to bring it out.<p>In Billy Batson's (Asher Angel) case, by shouting out
    one word--SHAZAM!--this streetwise 14-year-old foster kid can turn
    into the adult Super Hero Shazam (Zachary Levi),
    courtesy of an ancient wizard.</p> Still a kid at heart--inside a ripped,
    godlike body--Shazam revels in this adult version of himself by doing
    what any teen would do with superpowers: have fun with them!
    Can he fly? Does he have X-ray vision? Can he shoot lightning out of his hands?
    Can he skip his social studies test?
    Shazam sets out to test the limits of his abilities
    with the joyful recklessness of a child.
    But he'll need to master these powers quickly
    in order to fight the deadly forces of evil controlled by Dr. Thaddeus Sivana (Strong).
